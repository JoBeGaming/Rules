# ORE Staff Code of Conduct
1. **Professionalism**: As a staff member on ORE, you are expected to behave in a professional manner. This means treating all members with respect and courtesy, avoiding getting involved in conflict or controversy, working in a timely manner, and being accountable for your actions.
2. **Confidentiality**: Your position as a staff member gives you access to various kinds of privileged information, including information about players, private internal documents, and internal communications. Sharing or leaking any of this information is strictly forbidden. Misuse of privileged information is subject to disciplinary action.
3. **Openness & Transparency**: In order to effectively run and moderate the community, all staff members need to be aware of what's going on. For this reason, all moderation actions, or any privileged action that affects the community or any of its members, must be recorded somewhere where other staff members will see it.
4. **Conflicts of Interest**: Staff members may participate in other organizations or projects, provided their involvement does not conflict with OREâ€™s mission or duties. If any affiliation risks compromising your impartiality or decision-making, you must disclose it and abstain from related votes or actions to protect the integrity of ORE.
5. **Follow Through Example**: Our rules reflect what we enforce and how we behave ourselves. Staff members are expected to reflect the behavior they expect and to follow the rules they enforce; conducting themselves as an example for the community.

*You are expected to hold yourself and all other staff members accountable to this code of conduct. Please report any violations so that a staff decision can be made regarding the offense. While a single violation __may__ only result in a warning, repeated or egregious violations or a pattern of behavior will result in disciplinary action.*
