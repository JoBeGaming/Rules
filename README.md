# Rules

Here at the Open Redstone Engineers, we have few restrictions. Instead, we expect our members to be mature and respectful towards each other.

Guidelines:

Maintain polite conversation (do not badmouth other players or engage in excessive swearing).
Respect the boundaries of plots and their owners’ rules.
Give credit to all work that is borrowed. Any and ALL plagiarism will result in a ban. (This is of course referring to things more considerable than simply logic gates, where the number of possible designs is limited).
Avoid causing a lot of lag with WorldEdit. A useful tip may be to keep the light updates to a minimum – for instance, make huge floors glass.
Do not ask for a rank increase.
Generally be kind to others.
