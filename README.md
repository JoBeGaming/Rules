# Community Guidelines

## Overview

The Open Redstone Engineers (ORE) community has garnered a reputation over the years of being the elite computational redstone server. At ORE, we strive for greatness and the advancement of computational redstone.

## The ORE Community

The ORE community refers to all systems that ORE Staff officially maintain. The included systems are as follows:

- The ORE Minecraft Network
- The ORE Discord server
- The ORE Discourse forum
- The ORE IRC channel
- The ORE GitHub organization

## Guidelines

In short, ORE has a only a few rules that can be summarized as:

1. Don't be a dick
2. Listen to Staff

However, to be more specific, the following items *blahblah*:

1. Maintain polite conversation.
	1.   Do not badmouth other players or engage in excessive swearing.
2. Refrain from using language or posting content that can reasonably be considered discriminatory.
	1. More details regarding this can be found in [Sensitive Items](#sensitive-items)
3. Do not spam or excessively send multiple messages, including repeated questions and links too frequently.
	1. We understand that it can be frustrating to not be heard sometimes, but that is not an excuse to spam.
4. Do not take credit for creations that are not your own.
	1. Any plagiarism may result in a reprimand.
5. Your account is your responsibility.
	1.  If actions are performed under your account, you will be held liable.
6. Respect the boundaries of plots and their owners’ rules.
	1. If a player does 
7. Advertising is strictly prohibited unless first approved by the Staff team.
8. Avoid causing a lot of lag with WorldEdit.
9. Do not post NSFW(18+) material to any service.

## Sensitive Items

Particularly severe issues represent a behavior and a kind of person we don't want associated with ORE. These behaviors may result in repurcussions without warning:

* Racial slurs or racist speech
* Sexist slurs or sexist speech
* Homophobic or transphobic slurs or speech
* Ableist slurs or speech — there's confusion around this term, so to help clarify:
    * Ableist slurs are words that refer to people with disabilities used as insults
    * Ableist speech is hate speech directed towards people with disabilities
* Any other hate speech not already listed
* Doxxing people
* Personal attacks

This list is not exhaustive. If someone is engaging in bad behavior not conducive to a friendly environment and we believe it warrants action, then we will take action.

## Punishments

The ORE Staff does not have any set punishments for violations of our guidelines. In place of that, ORE Staff takes into account context, historic and present, to determine the best form of punishment. It is not uncommon for such punishment to be the result of a Staff vote.

Because of this, some actions may only receive warnings for some users, while other users could be banned permanently given their punishment history.

## Support

Our support channels can be found on Discord under `#help` and `#server-help`. While we do appreciate members who provide help in these channels, please be sure to follow our guidelines there as well. However, not everyone who asks for help is familiar with how everything works. Because of this, be mindfull of newcomers; we all start somewhere. In general, all the same rules apply. However, off-topic discussion is not permitted in these channels and therefore any and all off-topic discussion is subject to deletion.

## Appeals
If you have been banned ingame, on Discord, or on IRC, we offer an appeal process. To appeal, visit [our discourse appeals page](https://discourse.openredstone.org/c/moderation/appeals/31) to write an appeal.
